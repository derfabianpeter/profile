# Conventional Commits
```
The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
```

This repository uses `Conventional Commits` to automate `Versioning` and `CHANGELOG generation`. Learn more [HERE](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
